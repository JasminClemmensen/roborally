This dal package is focused on connection between RoboRally application and the database.
We have Connector class, which connect our RoboRally application with database "MarieDB",
and create database schema/table to insert values in it after.
{@link dk.dtu.compute.se.pisd.roborally.dal.Connector Connector}
We can see the game that exists in the database by using GameInDB class.
{@link dk.dtu.compute.se.pisd.roborally.dal.GameInDB GameInDB}

The class includes saving the application in database,
load the application from database and finding the application that is currently stored in database.

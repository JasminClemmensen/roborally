This controller package is very important in RoboRally application. because we create and have all important and required things,
functions and methods to run, start the game and to see something happening on the board.
And here we use AppController class that implements Observer to create all important functions and methods to run and start the game.
{@link dk.dtu.compute.se.pisd.roborally.controller.AppController AppController}
We have an abstract FieldAction class, which executes for a given space. In order to be able to do
that the GameController associated with the game is passed to this method.
{@link dk.dtu.compute.se.pisd.roborally.controller.FieldAction FieldAction}
We have as well a GameController class with some dummy controller operation
that interacts when the players do some actions in the GUI to make a simple move to see something happening on the board.
And that we see happening on the board, it's due to the controlling part of the game.
{@link dk.dtu.compute.se.pisd.roborally.controller.GameController GameController}.
